				<h2>Cool Game: Formless Star</h2>
				<h3 class="byline">Sunday, June 1st, 2025</h3>
				
				<p>Hot on the heels of my <em>Franken</em> recommendation is a new game by Splendidland, <a href="https://splendidland.itch.io/formless-star"><em>Formless Star</em></a>, a short and lovely JRPG style game taking pretty direct inspiration from the relatively recently localized PlayStation game <em>Moon</em> (which is also great).</p>
				
				<p>You play as a member of a crew that was hired by a space cartographer to document an endlessly changing planet by finding and identifying all of the animals that live there. The way you do this is by wandering around the map through its various biomes and interacting with anything interesting. If you get stuck or run out of places to look you can teleport back to your ship and go inside. When you go back outside the planet will have reformed itself.</p>
				
				<p>Each area looks incredible and you can easily clear obstacles or build bridges, so wandering around is a fun and relaxing experience.</p>

				<p>The animal designs and their interactions are all pretty great. I don’t want to spoil much so I’m only going to share a screenshot of #1.</p>

				<p>The writing is really nice and thoughtful too. I’m not going to go as far as to say this game is good for your mental health because I’m not a doctor, but it might be, so do yourself a favor and try it out.</p>
